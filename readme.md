# An exploratory data analysis project.
- Analyzed data for 1.2 million+ rows and 24 columns using Pandas and NumPy.
- Created visualizations (histograms, bar graphs, scatter plots, etc.) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Discovered that artists always prefer to release their songs in the month of January.
